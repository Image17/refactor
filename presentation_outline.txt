What we did - instance field refactor (tyler)


code design (tyler)
	visitor harvesting data
	class to hold datastructure
	helper classes with functions
	visit - precondition - rename

maybe visitor and statement handler?

preconditions (ryan)
existence
	instance variable exists with name - type, modifier, etc don't matter
duplicate
	instance variable with same name already exists - type, modifier, etc don't matter
shadow
	shadows parent
	shadows child
	shadows local fields in class
	matrix of parent child eligibility for interfaces and objects, how many parents/ children there could be
